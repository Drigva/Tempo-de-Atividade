# Activity Time

This is a version of Jhon Pérgon's "[Daily Usage Time](https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/495610-tempo-de-uso-di%C3%A1rio)" userscript, modified to track only the active tab's time, reducing RAM usage, especially for users who frequently open many tabs.

## How to Use it?
1. You need to have an extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed on your browser, which allows users to run "user scripts" on web pages.
2. Click here to intall the userscript → [Click Me シ](https://github.com/Drigva/Tempo-de-Atividade/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Tempo%20em%20Atividade.user.js)
